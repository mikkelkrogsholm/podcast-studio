# Step 12: Event Hooks and Extension System

## Overview
Step 12 implements a minimal event emitter system that provides hook points for future feature extensions without adding any current functionality. This creates a foundation for event-driven features like show notes generation, RSS feeds, or analytics.

## Implementation Date
- Branch: `feat/step_12`
- Completed: September 2025

## Primary Purpose
Create internal event hooks that allow future modules to react to session lifecycle events (particularly session completion) without modifying core business logic. The implementation follows a no-op pattern - events are emitted and consumed but produce no side effects.

## Architecture

### Event Emitter Module
**Location**: `packages/shared/src/events.ts`

The EventEmitter class provides:
- `on(event, listener)`: Register event listeners
- `off(event, listener)`: Remove specific listeners
- `emit(event, payload)`: Trigger all listeners for an event

TypeScript-first design with full type safety:
```typescript
type EventMap = {
  'session:completed': {
    sessionId: string
    status?: string
    duration?: number
    completedAt?: number
    title?: string
    persona_prompt?: string
    context_prompt?: string
    messageCount?: number
  }
}
```

### API Integration
**Location**: `apps/api/src/server.ts`

1. **Global EventEmitter Instance**: Created and exported at server startup
2. **No-op Subscriber**: Registered during bootstrap to consume events without side effects
3. **Event Emission**: Triggered in `/api/session/:id/finish` endpoint after successful completion

Event payload includes:
- Session ID and completion status
- Duration calculated from timestamps
- Session metadata (title, prompts)
- Message count from transcript

### Development Logging
In non-production environments, events are logged with prefix `[EVENT]` for debugging:
```
[EVENT] session:completed emitted: {
  sessionId: 'xxx',
  status: 'completed',
  duration: 12345,
  timestamp: '2025-09-13T...'
}
```

## Test Coverage
**Location**: `apps/api/src/routes/finish.test.ts`

Tests verify:
- Event emitter is called with correct payload on session finish
- Event payload structure matches expectations
- No event emission when session finish fails
- Graceful handling of event emission failures
- No-op subscriber has no observable side effects

## Important Files

### Core Implementation
- `packages/shared/src/events.ts` - EventEmitter class and type definitions
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` - Module exports
- `apps/api/src/server.ts` - Event emitter integration and bootstrap

### Tests
- `apps/api/src/routes/finish.test.ts` - Integration tests for event emission

## Usage Example

Future modules can subscribe to events:
```typescript
import { eventEmitter } from '@podcast-studio/api/server'

// Subscribe to session completion
eventEmitter.on('session:completed', async (payload) => {
  // Generate show notes
  // Update RSS feed
  // Send analytics
  // etc.
})
```

## Design Decisions

1. **No-op by Default**: Events are consumed but produce no side effects, ensuring zero impact on current functionality
2. **Minimal Surface Area**: Only `session:completed` event implemented, others can be added as needed
3. **Shared Package**: EventEmitter lives in shared package for potential frontend/backend reuse
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with event payload typing
5. **Error Isolation**: Event emission failures don't affect core business logic

## Future Extension Points

This foundation enables:
- **Show Notes Generation**: Auto-generate episode descriptions from transcripts
- **RSS Feed Updates**: Publish new episodes automatically
- **Analytics Tracking**: Record session metrics and usage patterns
- **Webhook Notifications**: Alert external services of new content
- **Export Pipelines**: Trigger post-processing workflows
- **AI Summaries**: Generate episode summaries and highlights

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
pnpm test
```

All 55 tests pass including new event emitter integration tests.

## Migration Notes

No database migrations required. The event system is purely runtime-based with no persistence layer.

## Security Considerations

- Events contain no sensitive data (API keys, tokens)
- Event payloads use existing session data already in database
- No external network calls in current implementation
- Future subscribers should validate payloads before processing
