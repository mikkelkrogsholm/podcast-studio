# Step 10: Session Management - Stop/Interrupt Implementation

## Overview
This document captures the implementation details for Step 10 of the podcast studio project, which adds robust session management capabilities including stop, interrupt, and reconnect functionality.

## Branch Information
- **Branch Name**: `feat/step_10`
- **Implementation Date**: September 2025
- **Status**: Complete, all tests passing

## Features Implemented

### 1. Session Finish Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/session/:id/finish`
- Sets session status to 'completed'
- Records `completed_at` timestamp
- Calculates and stores audio file durations from WAV headers
- Returns success response with completion timestamp

### 2. Stop Recording Functionality
**Component**: Stop button in UI
- Gracefully stops both audio recorders (human and AI tracks)
- Calls finish endpoint to mark session as complete
- Closes WebRTC/Realtime API connection
- Provides user feedback on successful stop

### 3. AI Speech Interrupt
**Component**: Interrupt button (red X icon)
- Only visible when AI is actively speaking
- Immediately cancels ongoing AI response using OpenAI's `response.cancel`
- Logs interrupt event to transcript
- Provides visual feedback to user

### 4. Reconnect Logic
**Implementation**: Exponential backoff with max 2 retries
- First retry: 1 second delay
- Second retry: 2 second delay
- User notification on connection loss and reconnect attempts
- Automatic session recovery on successful reconnect

## Key Files Modified

### Backend (API)
- **`apps/api/src/server.ts`**:
  - Added `calculateWavDurationMs()` function for WAV file duration calculation
  - Enhanced `/api/session/:id/finish` endpoint with duration calculation
  - Added error handling for missing audio files

- **`apps/api/src/routes/sessions.spec.ts`** (NEW):
  - Test suite for finish endpoint
  - Validates `completed_at` and duration fields
  - Ensures proper session status updates

### Frontend (Web)
- **`apps/web/src/hooks/useRealtimeConnection.ts`**:
  - Added `isAiSpeaking` state tracking
  - Implemented `interrupt()` method
  - Added reconnect logic with exponential backoff
  - Enhanced event handling for AI speech detection

- **`apps/web/src/components/TopBar.tsx`**:
  - Added interrupt button with conditional visibility
  - Enhanced stop button to call finish endpoint
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback

- **`apps/web/src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`**:
  - Added bilingual translations for new UI elements:
    - Danish: "Afbryd AI" (Interrupt AI)
    - English: "Interrupt AI"
    - Error messages and status updates

- **`apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`**:
  - Integrated session finishing logic
  - Added interrupt handler
  - Enhanced state management for recording controls

### Test Files
- **`apps/web/e2e/session-management.spec.ts`** (NEW):
  - E2E tests for interrupt functionality
  - Tests conditional visibility of interrupt button
  - Validates interrupt event logging

## Technical Implementation Details

### WAV Duration Calculation
The `calculateWavDurationMs()` function reads WAV file headers to extract:
- Sample rate (typically 48000 Hz)
- Bits per sample (16-bit)
- Number of channels (1 for mono)
- Data chunk size

Duration formula: `(dataSize / (sampleRate * channels * bytesPerSample)) * 1000`

For non-WAV or missing files, the function gracefully returns 0.

### AI Speaking State Detection
Tracks AI speaking state using OpenAI Realtime API events:
- `response.audio.delta` - AI starts speaking
- `response.audio.done` - AI finishes speaking
- `response.cancelled` - AI speech interrupted

### Reconnect Strategy
```typescript
const attemptReconnect = async (attempt = 0) => {
  if (attempt >= MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS) {
    // Give up after 2 attempts
    return;
  }

  const delay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000; // 1s, 2s
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));

  try {
    await connect();
  } catch (error) {
    attemptReconnect(attempt + 1);
  }
};
```

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- ✅ API finish endpoint sets `completed_at`
- ✅ Duration calculation for audio files
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing files
- ✅ Session status updates to 'completed'

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- ✅ Interrupt button visibility during AI speech
- ✅ Interrupt functionality stops AI speech
- ✅ Interrupt event logging to transcript

### Test Results
- **API Tests**: 41/41 passing
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors
- **Coverage**: All acceptance criteria met

## Database Schema Updates
No schema changes required. Uses existing fields:
- `sessions.completed_at` - Timestamp when session finished
- `sessions.status` - Updated to 'completed'
- `audio_files.duration` - Stores calculated duration in milliseconds

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- Stop button changes to loading state during processing
- Interrupt button only appears when needed (AI speaking)
- Clear error messages in user's selected language
- Connection status indicators during reconnect attempts

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing audio files
- User-friendly error messages for network issues
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Session state preserved during temporary disconnections

## Integration with Existing Features
- Works seamlessly with dual-track recording (Step 4)
- Preserves auto-save functionality (Step 5)
- Maintains transcript persistence (Step 6)
- Compatible with playground controls (Step 7)
- Respects persona/context settings (Step 8)

## Known Limitations
- Maximum 2 reconnect attempts (by design)
- Interrupt may have slight delay (~100ms) due to network latency
- Duration calculation requires valid WAV headers

## Future Enhancements (Step 11+)
- Session history will show completion times and durations
- Export functionality will use calculated durations
- Analytics can track interrupt frequency and session lengths

## Deployment Notes
- No environment variable changes required
- No database migrations needed
- Backward compatible with existing sessions
- Can be deployed without downtime
