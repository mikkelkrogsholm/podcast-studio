# Step 10 Implementation Test

## Features Implemented

### 1. Stop Button Enhancement
- ✅ Enhanced stop button functionality in TopBar
- ✅ Calls POST `/sessions/:id/finish` endpoint when stopping recording
- ✅ Closes WebRTC/Realtime connection via existing disconnect logic
- ✅ Shows appropriate feedback to user through console logs

### 2. Interrupt Button
- ✅ Only visible when AI is actively speaking (`isAiSpeaking` state)
- ✅ Immediately stops AI speech when clicked using OpenAI's `response.cancel`
- ✅ Logs interrupt event to transcript with `[INTERRUPTED]` message
- ✅ Uses OpenAI Realtime API's interrupt functionality

### 3. Reconnect Logic
- ✅ Added exponential backoff (1s, 2s delays)
- ✅ Maximum of 2 retry attempts
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. AI Speaking State Tracking
- ✅ Tracks AI speaking state via OpenAI events:
  - `response.created` → AI starts speaking
  - `response.done` → AI finishes speaking
  - `response.cancelled` → AI interrupted
- ✅ Interrupt button only appears during AI speech

### 5. Bilingual UI Support
- ✅ Danish translations added for all new features
- ✅ English translations added for all new features
- ✅ Proper tooltip texts for stop and interrupt buttons

## Files Modified

1. **`apps/web/src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`**
   - Added translations for interrupt functionality
   - Added session management translations
   - Enhanced tooltips for better UX

2. **`apps/web/src/hooks/useRealtimeConnection.ts`**
   - Added `interrupt()` function using `response.cancel`
   - Added `isAiSpeaking` state tracking
   - Implemented reconnect logic with exponential backoff
   - Enhanced AI speaking state management

3. **`apps/web/src/components/TopBar.tsx`**
   - Added interrupt button that appears only when AI is speaking
   - Enhanced stop button with better tooltips
   - Added proper TypeScript types

4. **`apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`**
   - Enhanced stop recording to call finish endpoint
   - Added interrupt handler
   - Connected AI speaking state to TopBar

## Testing Notes

To test the implementation:

1. **Stop Button**: Start recording, then click stop - should call finish endpoint
2. **Interrupt Button**: During recording, wait for AI to speak, then click interrupt
3. **Reconnect**: Disconnect network briefly to test reconnection logic
4. **UI Language**: Toggle between Danish/English to verify translations

## API Endpoint Usage

The implementation uses the existing `POST /sessions/:id/finish` endpoint which:
- Marks session as completed
- Updates `completedAt` timestamp
- Returns success/failure status

## Architecture Notes

- Interrupt functionality uses OpenAI's native `response.cancel` command
- AI speaking state tracked through OpenAI's event system
- Reconnect logic handles connection failures gracefully
- UI remains responsive during all operations
